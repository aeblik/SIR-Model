## Epidemiological Modeling: SIR Model

**General Information** The steps, calculations, results, and code of your projects are to be documented in a report. The following points have to be done/answered in any case (points with an \* are optional)

1.  Classify the PDE
2.  Try to find some information about the PDE and describe it shortly
3.  Make reasonable assumptions and choices and shortly explain your assumptions and choices:
    1.  What FD scheme is suited for the problem (Finite Difference Schema)
    2.  What BC is suited
    3.  What IC makes sense
        1.  Constants in the equations (e.g. diffusion constant, etc.)
4.  Discretise the PDE using FD approximations
5.  Analyse the step-wise order of the error of the FD approximation
6.  Solve the PDE (for time-dependent PDEs, i.e. you observe how it changes after a certain time)
7.  Investigate the stability of the scheme (in the case of non-linear PDEs you may simply investigate stability in an experimental fashion)
8.  Play around with different values of the coefficients.
9.  Visualise the solution(s)
10. \* Solve the PDE using various schemes and compare them
11. \* Make an error estimation for one of the solutions

Comments

$$
∇^2 = \partial_{xx} + \partial{yy}

### Task:

Description: Simulate the spread of an infectious disease using the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. Explore the impact of transmission and recovery rates on the spatial dynamics of the epidemic.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} &= -\beta \cdot \frac{S \cdot I}{N} \\
\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} &= D_i\nabla^2 I + \beta \cdot \frac{S \cdot I}{N} - \gamma \cdot I \\
\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} &= \gamma \cdot I
\end{aligned}
$$

**Parameters and Variables:**

-   S : Susceptible individuals density (individuals /cm2)

-   I : Infectious individuals density (individuals /cm2)

-   R : Recovered individuals density (individuals /cm2)β : Transmission rate ( day −1)

-   γ : Recovery rate ( day −1)N : Total population (22)

-   Di: Diffusion coefficient for I (cm2/ day ) (23)

**Typical values:**

Ds = 0.01 − 0.1 cm2/ day,

Di = 0.01 − 0.1 cm2/ day,

β = 0.1 − 0.5 day −1,

γ = 0.05 − 0.2 day −1,

N = 1000 − 5000

### Theory:

Description of the PED:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} &= -\beta \cdot \frac{S \cdot I}{N} \\
\frac{\partial I}{\partial t} &= D_i\nabla^2 I + \beta \cdot \frac{S \cdot I}{N} - \gamma \cdot I \\
\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} &= \gamma \cdot I
\end{aligned}
$$ 1. Susceptible (S) Equation: ∂t∂S​=−β⋅NS⋅I​

This equation describes the rate at which the susceptible population density changes over time.

|  |  |  |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Term | Symbol/Component | Simple Explanation |
| **Rate of Change of** S | ∂t∂S​ | **How quickly the density of susceptible individuals changes** over time. |
| **Infection Rate (Loss of** S**)** | −β⋅NS⋅I​ | This is the **rate at which susceptible individuals become infected** and move out of the S compartment. Since S decreases due to infection, this term is negative. The rate depends on: |
|  | β | The **Transmission rate** (how fast the disease spreads upon contact). |
|  | S⋅I/N | The probability of interaction between susceptible (S) and infectious (I) individuals, normalized by the total population (N). |

2\. Infectious (I) Equation: ∂t∂I​=Di​∇2I+β⋅NS⋅I​−γ⋅I

This equation is the core of the PDE system, showing how the infectious population density changes due to three processes: spreading, being infected, and recovering.

|  |  |  |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Term | Symbol/Component | Simple Explanation |
| **Rate of Change of** I | ∂t∂I​ | **How quickly the density of infectious individuals changes** over time. |
| **Spatial Diffusion** | Di​∇2I | This is the **diffusion term**, representing the **spatial spreading** or movement of infectious individuals across the region. Diffusion models movement from high density areas to low density areas. |
|  | Di​ | The **Diffusion coefficient** for I, determining the speed of this spatial movement. |
|  | ∇2I | The **Laplace operator**, quantifying spatial curvature, or how the infectious density changes with respect to surrounding space. |
| **New Infections (Gain to** I**)** | +β⋅NS⋅I​ | This is the **gain** of new infectious individuals (coming from the S compartment). This is the same magnitude as the loss term in the S equation, but positive here. |
| **Recovery Rate (Loss of** I**)** | −γ⋅I | This is the **rate at which infectious individuals recover** and leave the I compartment. Since I decreases due to recovery, this term is negative. |
|  | γ | The **Recovery rate** (how fast individuals leave the infectious state). |

3\. Recovered (R) Equation: ∂t∂R​=γ⋅I

This equation describes the rate at which individuals enter the recovered population.

|  |  |  |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Term | Symbol/Component | Simple Explanation |
| **Rate of Change of** R | ∂t∂R​ | **How quickly the density of recovered individuals changes** over time. |
| **Recovery (Gain to** R**)** | +γ⋅I | This is the **gain** of new recovered individuals (coming from the I compartment). This is the same magnitude as the loss term in the I equation, but positive here. |

### What model is it:

A **Standard (Non-Spatial) SIR Model** tracks the progression of a disease within a single, homogeneous population solely over **time**,. These models describe individuals moving between susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered (R) states using kinetic terms, often expressed using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) or Discrete Difference Equations.

A **Reaction-Diffusion System** is a mathematical classification for complex phenomena described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that depend on both time and space,. This system combines two components: **Reaction** (local changes, representing kinetic transitions or biological feedback loops) and **Diffusion** (spatial transport or spreading from areas of high concentration to low concentration,).

A **Spatial SIR Model** is explicitly an example of a Reaction-Diffusion system. The key difference is that the Spatial SIR incorporates spatial variables into its equations, simulating disease spread over **time AND space**. The inherent disease dynamics are the "reaction" part, while the spread of infectious individuals across a geographic region (via the ∇2 term) is the "diffusion" part, requiring PDEs for its formulation.
